    <h1>Shadows of Becoming</h1>
    <h4>by Katelynn Calvert</h4>
    <img src="boyW_shadow.mp4" width="500" />
    <p>This artwork draws inspiration from Chris Milk's "The Treachery of Sanctuary," a set of three 30ft digital panels that respond to audience movement. While Milk's piece takes participants on a journey of emergence through representations of birth, death, and transfiguration, this work reimagines these themes using hand-drawn images as its foundation. This approach connects with the human-made element before introducing digital alterations, bridging traditional and contemporary artistic techniques.
The piece incorporates shadowlike and transformative elements from Milk's work, opting to keep an animal as the shadow for a clearer representation of achieving grandeur and visual appeal. The creation process involved physically drawing the changes in the child's shadow to create panels of a 2D animation. These hand-drawn images were then used as keyframes in a video-generating AI, introducing digital elements that echo the inspiration piece and help smooth out the work.
Inspired by Milk's digital realization of cave paintings, this artwork explores similar narrative themes of emergence and transformation. The final work was rendered warmly due to the lighting from the frames, producing a certain dreaminess that contrasts nicely with the harshness and intensity of Milk's installation.</p>
